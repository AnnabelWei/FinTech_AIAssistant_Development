# Development Plan for AI Assistant for Fintech Customer Service

## Introduction

In this development plan, I will outline the steps to create and deploy an AI assistant to aid customer service representatives in a fintech startup. The AI assistant will have knowledge of various internal documents, including customer data, regulatory compliance information, and internal company policies. Data privacy concerns will be paramount, especially when interacting with external APIs.

## Technologies and Tools

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- **OpenAI API**: Utilise OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities for understanding and generating human-like text responses.

### Database Management
- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)**: Use a secure RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store and manage customer data securely.

### Data Privacy and Security
- **Encryption**: Implement encryption techniques to secure sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Utilise role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles.
- **Tokenisation**: Use tokenisation to protect sensitive data when communicating with external APIs.
- **Secure Communication Protocols**: Implement secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) when interacting with external APIs.

### Chatbot Development Framework
- **Rasa**: Use Rasa framework for building and deploying conversational AI chatbots.
- **Python**: Implement custom logic and integrations using Python programming language.

### Knowledge Base Question-Answering (QA) System
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Utilise BERT for building a knowledge-based QA system to provide real-time answers to customer queries.
- **Hugging Face Transformers Library**: Use Hugging Face's Transformers library for fine-tuning BERT on internal documents.

### Rule-Based System
- **Custom Rules Engine**: Implement a rule-based system to handle specific scenarios and questions that can be addressed with predefined rules.

### Cloud Platform
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Utilise AWS for scalable and reliable deployment of the AI assistant.

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Data Collection and Integration

- Retrieve customer data from the relational database securely.
- Access regulatory compliance information and company policies from the internal file system.
- Encrypt sensitive data before storage and transmission.

### Step 2: Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

- Utilise OpenAI API for NLU tasks such as intent classification and entity recognition.
- Train the NLU model using labelled data to improve accuracy.

### Step 3: Knowledge Base QA System Development

- Preprocess and index internal documents for the knowledge base QA system.
- Fine-tune BERT on internal documents using the Hugging Face Transformers library.
- Implement a question-answering API to provide real-time answers to customer queries.

### Step 4: Rule-Based System Development

- Define and implement rules to handle specific scenarios and questions.
- Integrate the rule-based system with the AI assistant to complement the knowledge-based QA system.

### Step 5: AI Assistant Development

- Develop conversational AI capabilities to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.
- Incorporate the knowledge base QA system and the rule-based system into the AI assistant.
- Ensure data privacy by applying encryption, access control, tokenisation, and secure communication protocols when communicating with external APIs.

### Step 6: Deployment and Testing

- Containerise the AI assistant application using Docker.
- Deploy Docker containers to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for scalable and reliable deployment.
- Test the AI assistant thoroughly, including data privacy and security tests.
- Monitor application performance and security post-deployment.

## Conclusion

By following this development plan and utilising the specified technologies and tools, can create a secure and efficient AI assistant to support customer service representatives in a fintech startup. This AI assistant will have knowledge of various internal documents and utilise a combination of a knowledge-based question-answering system, a rule-based system, and data privacy measures to provide accurate and reliable assistance to customers while ensuring data privacy and security.

## Code Snippets

### Sample Python code for fine-tuning BERT on internal documents:

```python
from transformers import BertForQuestionAnswering, BertTokenizer
import torch

# Load pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = BertForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Define sample text and question
text = "Customer data privacy is our top priority."
question = "What is our top priority?"

# Tokenize text and question
inputs = tokenizer(question, text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)

# Get start and end logits for answer
start_logits, end_logits = model(**inputs)

# Get the most likely answer
all_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs["input_ids"].squeeze())
answer_tokens = all_tokens[torch.argmax(start_logits) : torch.argmax(end_logits) + 1]
answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(answer_tokens)

print("Answer:", answer)


### Sample Dockerfile for containerising the application:

# Use official Python image as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependencies file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
